# cs-dtw

This project performs dtw calculations on compute shaders. Place the input in the InputGesture folder and templates in templates folder. Current version does no support more input than template so keep the input either the same or less than number of templates. The project is loaded with an example run of 1 input with 6 bones comparing to 10 templates with 6 bones.
